                Hello!
 
My name is Krista Berry.  I currently live in Pea Ridge, Arkansas.  I've worked as a developer for about 3 years now, primarily SQL, C#, and PowerShell.  I have taken a web programming class before and spent some time teaching myself HTML when it was brand new back in the 90s.    I've forgotten a LOT so I'm looking forward to learning again and possibly taking my skills to the next level.
 
<!--A few things about me: I'm unmarried, no kids, too many pets (2 Pembroke Welsh Corgis named Ziggy and Zelda and 2 cats named Hedwig and Tola).  When I'm not working my full time job, working on my various callings at church, or taking care of the pets, I enjoy reading, crocheting and playing video games.  I'm looking forward to getting to know everyone better.-->
            </p>

            <p>
                Arkansas is a landlocked state in the West South Central region of the Southern United States. 
                It borders Missouri to the north, Tennessee and Mississippi to the east, Louisiana to the south, 
                Texas to the southwest, and Oklahoma to the west. Its name derives from the Osage language, and 
                refers to their relatives, the Quapaw people.  The state's diverse geography ranges from the 
                mountainous regions of the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains, which make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, 
                to the densely forested land in the south known as the Arkansas Timberlands, to the eastern lowlands 
                along the Mississippi River and the Arkansas Delta.
