                Hello!
 
My name is Krista Berry.  I currently live in Pea Ridge, Arkansas.  I've worked as a developer for about 3 years now, primarily SQL, C#, and PowerShell.  I have taken a web programming class before and spent some time teaching myself HTML when it was brand new back in the 90s.    I've forgotten a LOT so I'm looking forward to learning again and possibly taking my skills to the next level.
 
A few things about me: I'm unmarried, no kids, too many pets (2 Pembroke Welsh Corgis named Ziggy and Zelda and 2 cats named Hedwig and Tola).  When I'm not working my full time job, working on my various callings at church, or taking care of the pets, I enjoy reading, crocheting and playing video games.  I'm looking forward to getting to know everyone better.
